# About
QPysl4a is forked from https://www.github.com/damonkohler/sl4a/, and it provides the Android Layer APIs for script engine.

It is not a standalone project,  it will be included by QPython / QPython3 as a submodule.

# APIs Documentation
If you are looking for a solution to drive Android with Python, then maybe QPysl4a is exactly what you need. With the help of QPysl4a, you could call many Android APIs with Python code.
